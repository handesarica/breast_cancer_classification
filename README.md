# About Project
This project is developed for doctoral course within Erciyes University Computer Engineering. The project aim determine the breast images classification using deep learning methods for detect the breast cancer in early phase. 
# About Dataset
Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI), includes medical images of breast collected using ultrasound scan among women. Images are collected from in ages between 25 and 75 years old female patients at Baheya Hospital in Egypt. The dataset consist of 780 images and categorized into three classes, which are normal, benign, and malignant.
